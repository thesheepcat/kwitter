# Kwitter

## Scope
Kwitter is a decentralized microblogging platform running on the top of Kaspa network: it allows people to freely express themselves, without any censorship.


## User journey
Here i describe a high-level user journey including basic features of the app:

###  Creating an account
- User A activates the app for the first time and creates its own "Kwitter identity";
- This identity is unique in the whole network and represent only this specific user;
- User A locally backup the required data to restore its account, in case he needs to use it on another clinet;
- After creating its identity, User A fund its account by sending a small amount of KAS from his personal wallet, in order to pay for fees;
- User A broadcast the first message in Kwitter network, by informing everyone about his skills, interest, topics of choice, etc; in this way, he's promoting its new activity on the network.

###  Posting the first message
- User A posts his first message on Kwitter network, to let everyone know how exciting decentralization and Kaspa are.

###  Following/unfolloing and supporting/unsupporting a user
- User B, who already activated a Kwitter account last month, receive the broadcast message from User A and decides to follow him;
- User B activates the "following" proces: everytime User A posts something new, User B is alerted and visualize this new content on his Kwitter home page;
- User B decides that User A contents are interesting, therefore he chooses to support him;
- When activating the supporting process, User B is sending a certain amount of KAS to User A;
- User A is notified: now he knows User B is supporting him; in addition, everyone else in the network knows User A is supported by User B; 
- In the meantime, User C, another long time Kwitter user, received User A broadcast and start following and receiving notifications when User A posts something;
- But User C doesn't like User A contents, therefore he doesn't activate the supporting process and, after few days, he also unfollow User A.

###  Commenting user contents
- User A can setup his own account to:
  - Allow all users to comment his posts;
  - Allow only user who support him to comment his posts;
- User B can freely comment User A content (whether he support User A or not);
- Depending on User A settings (above), User A receive the comment, gets notified about the comment, read the comment or ignore it (not visualizing it).

###  Mentioning other users in posts or comment
- User A can setup his own account to:
  - Allow all users to mention him;
  - Allow only user who support him to to mention him;
- User B can freely mention User A on its posts or comments (whether he support User A or not);
- Depending on User A settings (above), User A receive the mention, gets notified about the mention, read the post/comments including the mention or ignore it (not visualizing it).

###  Rekweeting/quoting user contents
- User A can setup his own account to:
  - Gets notified if someone rekweet (forwarding a message, adding considerations) its content;
  - Gets notified if someone quotes (forwarding a message) its content;
- User B can freely rekweet and quote a User A content in it's own profile (whether he support User A or not);
- Depending on User A settings (above), User A receive the rekweet/quote, gets notified about the rekweet/quote, read the rekweet/quote or ignore it (not visualizing it).

###  User history
- When User B starts following or supporting (TBD) User A, he'll receive all past contents posted by User A in the past.

###  Blocking users
- Even if User B follow or support User A, User A can freely decide to block User B, blocking notifications related to all main actions (comments, mentions, retweek, quotes);
- User B can freely mention User A and comment, retweek and quote User A contents but User A will never be notified about these actions.
